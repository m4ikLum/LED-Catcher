# LED-Catcher
Get ready to play LED Catcher, a fast-paced and fun game on your FPGA board! The LED zips back and forth across the board like a streak of light, and your goal is to flip up the correct switch at just the right moment to catch it. Each successful catch earns you a point, and your score is proudly displayed on the seven-segment display for you to track your progress. Think you can beat your high score? Just press the reset button to start a new round and keep the fun going!

## To Use
Upload the files onto a project in Vivado. Program the FPGA board and the game is ready to go!
